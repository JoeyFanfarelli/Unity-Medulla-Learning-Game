# Unity-Medulla-Learning-Game
 A game that teaches brain structure and function. This project is a reminder of where I started in Unity C#. My first major project - the coding is... not ideal, but the game significantly and substantially improved learning and was rated as fun in experimentation.
 .exe is in the build folder.
